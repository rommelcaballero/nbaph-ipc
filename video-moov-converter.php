 * Moovrelocator
 * 
 * In H.264-based video formats (mp4, m4v) the metadata is called a "moov atom".
 * The moov atom is a part of the file that holds the index information for the 
 * whole file. Many encoding software programs such as FFMPEG will insert this 
 * moov atom information at the end of the video file. This is bad. The moov atom
 * needs to be located at the beginning of the file, or else the entire file will
 * have to be downloaded before it begins playing
 * (http://flowplayer.org/plugins/streaming/pseudostreaming.html).
